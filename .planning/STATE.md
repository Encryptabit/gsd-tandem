## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 5 phases derived from 25 requirements; research-suggested structure validated and adopted with minor regrouping
- [Roadmap]: INTER-05 (optimistic mode) kept as v1 despite research suggesting deferral; mapped to Phase 4 with GSD integration
- [01-01]: Added hatchling build-system to pyproject.toml for project.scripts entry point support
- [01-01]: Added Python/__pycache__/SQLite patterns to root .gitignore

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research Gap 3: Codex MCP client capabilities unverified -- test early in Phase 1
- Research Gap 2: Claude Code MCP_TIMEOUT configuration unclear -- determine empirically in Phase 1
