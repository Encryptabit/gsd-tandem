<objective>
Fenced reclaim logic: claim_generation fence tokens, claimed_at timestamps, claimed_by authorization, fence bypass prevention, active-status gate on claims, drain lifecycle completion, and stale verdict rejection.

Purpose: Prevent duplicate verdicts when a reviewer times out and its review is reclaimed by another reviewer. The fence token (claim_generation) ensures only the current claim holder can submit verdicts. The claimed_by check provides an orthogonal authorization layer that prevents foreign reviewers from submitting verdicts even when claim_generation is omitted for backward compatibility. A final safety net rejects verdicts on claimed reviews when BOTH identifiers are omitted, closing the bypass where a caller could skip all fencing by omitting both parameters. The active-status gate prevents draining/terminated reviewers from claiming new work. The drain finalization helper auto-terminates draining reviewers when their last claim is resolved (via terminal verdict or reclaim). This is the safety mechanism for the multi-reviewer pool.
Output: Modified claim_review and submit_verdict tools with fence token support, active-status gate, claimed_by authorization, bypass prevention, and drain lifecycle completion. reclaim_review helper with drain finalization. Comprehensive race-condition tests.

  **Add helper function `_maybe_finalize_draining_reviewer`:**

  Create an async helper function (can be module-level in tools.py or in a separate module -- executor's discretion, but tools.py is fine since it needs access to the app context):

  ```python
  async def _maybe_finalize_draining_reviewer(app: AppContext, reviewer_id: str, trigger: str) -> None:
  ```

  - If `reviewer_id` is None or empty, return immediately (nothing to check).
  - Query `SELECT status FROM reviewers WHERE id = ?` with reviewer_id.
  - If no row found OR status is NOT 'draining', return (nothing to do).
  - Count remaining claimed reviews: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM reviews WHERE status = 'claimed' AND claimed_by = ?`.
  - If count > 0, return (reviewer still has active claims, do not terminate yet).
  - If count == 0: the draining reviewer has no more work. Terminate them:
    - `UPDATE reviewers SET status = 'terminated', terminated_at = datetime('now') WHERE id = ?`
    - Record `reviewer_terminated` audit event with metadata `{reviewer_id, trigger, reason: "drain_complete"}`.
  - All DB operations inside the existing write_lock with BEGIN IMMEDIATE / COMMIT / ROLLBACK.

  **Modify `claim_review` -- add active-status gate BEFORE diff validation and claim UPDATE:**

  After verifying the review exists and is in a claimable state, but BEFORE the diff validation and the UPDATE that sets claimed_by:

  1. If `reviewer_id` is provided (not None/empty), query `SELECT status FROM reviewers WHERE id = ?` with the reviewer_id.
  2. If a row exists AND `status != 'active'`, ROLLBACK and return error dict: `{"error": "Reviewer {reviewer_id} is {status}, cannot claim new reviews"}`.
  3. If NO row exists in the reviewers table for this reviewer_id, ALLOW the claim to proceed. This preserves backward compatibility for manual/non-pool reviewers who are not tracked in the reviewers table.
  4. If reviewer_id is not provided, skip this check entirely (backward compat).

  **Modify `claim_review` -- fence token updates (existing from original plan):**
  - In the successful claim UPDATE statement, also set:
    - `claimed_at = datetime('now')`
    - `claim_generation = claim_generation + 1`
  - In the SELECT, also fetch `claim_generation` from the row.
  - After the UPDATE, read back the new claim_generation (it was incremented, so it's the old value + 1). Calculate it as `old_claim_generation + 1` where old_claim_generation is from the SELECT.
  - Include `claim_generation` in the successful claim response dict so reviewers know their fence token.
  - Keep backward compatibility: existing callers that ignore claim_generation still work.

  **Modify `submit_verdict`:**
  - Add two optional parameters to the function signature: `claim_generation: int | None = None` and `reviewer_id: str | None = None`.
  - Broker-managed verdict paths MUST pass `reviewer_id` on claimed reviews so the authorization and bypass prevention checks can function correctly.
  - In both the comment verdict and standard verdict paths, after fetching the review row, also SELECT `claim_generation` and `claimed_by` from the reviews table.

  - **Fence bypass prevention (MUST come first):** If the review's current status is 'claimed' AND BOTH `claim_generation` is None (not provided) AND `reviewer_id` is not provided (None or empty), ROLLBACK and return error dict: `{"error": "Claimed reviews require reviewer_id or claim_generation for verdict submission"}`. This closes the bypass where a caller omitting both parameters would skip all fencing checks on a claimed review. This check ONLY applies to reviews in 'claimed' status -- reviews in other statuses (e.g., reviews that were claimed and then had status manually changed, or legacy reviews) are unaffected for backward compatibility.

  - **Fence check (claim_generation):** If the caller provided `claim_generation` (not None), compare it to the row's current `claim_generation`. If they don't match, ROLLBACK and return error dict: `{"error": "Stale claim: review was reclaimed since your claim. Your generation=X, current=Y"}`.
  - If `claim_generation` is None (not provided) AND the review is not in claimed status, skip the fence check. This preserves backward compatibility with manual reviewers and external tools operating on non-claimed reviews.

  - **Authorization check (claimed_by):** If the review's current status is 'claimed' and `claimed_by` is not NULL, and `reviewer_id` is provided (not None/empty), verify that the `reviewer_id` parameter matches the row's `claimed_by` value. If they don't match, ROLLBACK and return error dict: `{"error": "Unauthorized: review is claimed by {claimed_by}, not {reviewer_id}"}`. This is an orthogonal safety net that prevents ANY foreign client from submitting verdicts on reviews claimed by broker-managed reviewers.

  **Check ordering in submit_verdict for claimed reviews:**
  1. Fence bypass prevention (both identifiers omitted on claimed review -> reject)
  2. Fence check (claim_generation mismatch -> reject)
  3. Authorization check (reviewer_id mismatch on claimed review -> reject)
  4. Proceed with verdict

  **Drain finalization in submit_verdict:**
  After a successful TERMINAL verdict path (approved or changes_requested -- NOT comment verdicts), invoke:
  ```python
  await _maybe_finalize_draining_reviewer(app, row_claimed_by, trigger="terminal_verdict")
  ```
  where `row_claimed_by` is the review's `claimed_by` value read from the row BEFORE the verdict update. This checks if the reviewer who owned this review is draining and has no more claims, then auto-terminates them.

  **Add internal `reclaim_review` function** (not an @mcp.tool, called by background tasks):
  ```python
  async def reclaim_review(review_id: str, app: AppContext, reason: str = "claim_timeout") -> dict:
  ```
  - Acquire write_lock.
  - BEGIN IMMEDIATE.
  - SELECT status, claimed_by, claim_generation FROM reviews WHERE id = review_id.
  - If status is not 'claimed', ROLLBACK, return error.
  - Capture the OLD `claimed_by` value before clearing it.
  - UPDATE reviews SET status='pending', claimed_by=NULL, claimed_at=NULL, claim_generation=claim_generation+1, updated_at=datetime('now') WHERE id=review_id.
  - Record `review_reclaimed` audit event with actor="pool-manager", old_status="claimed", new_status="pending", metadata={old_reviewer: claimed_by, reason, claim_generation: new_value}.
  - COMMIT.
  - **Drain finalization after reclaim:** After COMMIT, invoke:
    ```python
    await _maybe_finalize_draining_reviewer(app, old_claimed_by, trigger="reclaim")
    ```
    Using the OLD claimed_by value (captured before the UPDATE cleared it). This handles the case where a draining reviewer's last claim is reclaimed due to timeout -- they should be auto-terminated since they now have zero remaining claims.
  - Notify on review_id and QUEUE_TOPIC.
  - Return success dict with review_id, new status, new claim_generation.

  Run `cd C:/Projects/gsd-tandem/tools/gsd-review-broker && uv run pytest tests/test_tools.py tests/test_proposals.py -v` -- all existing tests still pass (backward compatibility). Read tools.py to verify: (1) claim_generation is optional in submit_verdict, (2) claimed_by authorization check exists, (3) fence bypass prevention check exists for claimed reviews when both identifiers are omitted, (4) active-status gate exists in claim_review before diff validation, (5) _maybe_finalize_draining_reviewer is called in both submit_verdict (after terminal verdict) and reclaim_review (after clearing claimed_by).
  </verify>
  <done>
  claim_review rejects claims from draining/terminated reviewers (allows claims from unknown reviewer_ids for backward compat). claim_review returns claim_generation in response. submit_verdict accepts and checks claim_generation when provided. submit_verdict verifies claimed_by matches reviewer_id for claimed reviews (orthogonal authorization). submit_verdict rejects verdicts on claimed reviews when both claim_generation and reviewer_id are omitted (fence bypass prevention). submit_verdict auto-terminates draining reviewers after terminal verdict clears their last claim. reclaim_review transitions claimed reviews back to pending with incremented fence token and auto-terminates draining reviewers after reclaim clears their last claim.

  <action>
  Create comprehensive test file for the fenced reclaim system. Import create_review, claim_review, submit_verdict, reclaim_review, and close_review from tools module. Use conftest fixtures (ctx, db).

  **Tests:**

  1. **test_claim_review_returns_claim_generation**: Create review, claim it, verify response contains `claim_generation` key with value >= 1.

  2. **test_claim_review_sets_claimed_at**: Create review, claim it, verify `claimed_at` is set in the DB (SELECT reviews WHERE id=...).

  3. **test_submit_verdict_with_valid_claim_generation**: Create, claim (capture claim_generation from response), submit_verdict with that claim_generation. Verify success.

  4. **test_submit_verdict_with_stale_claim_generation**: Create, claim (gen=1), reclaim (gen becomes 2), claim again (gen=3), submit_verdict with gen=1. Verify error "Stale claim".

  5. **test_submit_verdict_without_claim_generation_backward_compat**: Create, claim, submit_verdict without claim_generation parameter BUT with reviewer_id matching the claimed_by. Verify success (fence check skipped because reviewer_id is provided and matches, satisfying the bypass prevention gate).

  6. **test_reclaim_review_transitions_to_pending**: Create, claim, reclaim. Verify status is 'pending', claimed_by is NULL.

  7. **test_reclaim_review_increments_claim_generation**: Create, claim (gen=1), reclaim. SELECT claim_generation, verify it's 2.

  8. **test_reclaim_review_clears_claimed_at**: Create, claim (claimed_at set), reclaim. Verify claimed_at is NULL.

  9. **test_reclaim_review_only_claimed_status**: Create review (pending), try reclaim. Verify error (not claimed).

  10. **test_full_race_scenario**: The critical end-to-end race test:
      - Create review.
      - Reviewer A claims (gets gen=1).
      - Review is reclaimed (gen becomes 2).
      - Reviewer B claims (gets gen=3).
      - Reviewer A tries submit_verdict with gen=1 -> REJECTED (stale).
      - Reviewer B submits verdict with gen=3 -> ACCEPTED.
      - Verify audit log shows reclaim event.

  11. **test_reclaim_records_audit_event**: Create, claim, reclaim. Query audit_events for review_reclaimed event. Verify metadata contains old_reviewer and reason.

  12. **test_comment_verdict_with_stale_claim_generation**: Same as test 4 but with verdict="comment". Verify stale check applies to comments too.

  13. **test_submit_verdict_wrong_reviewer_rejected**: Create review, claim with reviewer_id="reviewer-A". Then call submit_verdict with reviewer_id="reviewer-B" (a different reviewer). Verify error "Unauthorized: review is claimed by reviewer-A, not reviewer-B". This validates the claimed_by authorization check that prevents foreign clients from submitting verdicts regardless of claim_generation.

  14. **test_submit_verdict_correct_reviewer_accepted**: Create review, claim with reviewer_id="reviewer-A". Call submit_verdict with reviewer_id="reviewer-A" and valid claim_generation. Verify success. This confirms that the claimed_by check passes for the correct reviewer.

  15. **test_submit_verdict_no_reviewer_id_with_claim_generation_accepted**: Create review, claim with reviewer_id="reviewer-A". Call submit_verdict WITHOUT reviewer_id parameter but WITH valid claim_generation. Verify success -- claim_generation is provided so the bypass prevention gate passes, and the claimed_by check is skipped when reviewer_id is not provided.

  16. **test_submit_verdict_claimed_review_both_omitted_rejected**: Create review, claim with reviewer_id="reviewer-A". Call submit_verdict WITHOUT reviewer_id AND WITHOUT claim_generation (both omitted). Verify error: "Claimed reviews require reviewer_id or claim_generation for verdict submission". This is the critical fence bypass prevention test -- a caller cannot skip all fencing by omitting both identifiers on a claimed review.

  17. **test_submit_verdict_non_claimed_review_both_omitted_accepted**: Create a review, move it to a non-claimed status (e.g., directly set status to an appropriate state, or use a review that was never claimed). Call submit_verdict without reviewer_id and without claim_generation. Verify success -- the bypass prevention only applies to reviews in 'claimed' status. This confirms backward compatibility for non-claimed reviews.

  18. **test_claim_review_rejects_draining_reviewer**: Insert a reviewer row with status='draining' into the reviewers table. Create a review (pending). Call claim_review with that reviewer_id. Verify error indicating the reviewer is draining and cannot claim new reviews.

  19. **test_claim_review_rejects_terminated_reviewer**: Insert a reviewer row with status='terminated' into the reviewers table. Create a review (pending). Call claim_review with that reviewer_id. Verify error indicating the reviewer is terminated and cannot claim new reviews.

  20. **test_drain_finalization_after_terminal_verdict**: Insert a reviewer row with status='draining'. Create a review, claim it with that reviewer_id (note: you may need to insert the reviewer as 'active' first, then update to 'draining' after claiming, OR insert as 'draining' and directly set the review's claimed_by in the DB to simulate an already-claimed state). Submit a terminal verdict (approved). Verify the reviewer's status in the DB is now 'terminated' with terminated_at set, and a reviewer_terminated audit event was recorded with trigger="terminal_verdict".

  21. **test_drain_finalization_after_reclaim**: Insert a reviewer row with status='draining'. Set up a review claimed by that reviewer (directly in DB or by claiming while active then updating reviewer to draining). Call reclaim_review. Verify the reviewer's status is now 'terminated' with terminated_at set, and a reviewer_terminated audit event was recorded with trigger="reclaim".

  22. **test_drain_finalization_not_triggered_with_remaining_claims**: Insert a reviewer row with status='draining'. Create TWO reviews, both claimed by that reviewer (set up via DB). Submit a terminal verdict on ONE of them. Verify the reviewer's status is still 'draining' (NOT terminated) because they still have one remaining claimed review.

  23. **test_claim_review_allows_unknown_reviewer_id**: Do NOT insert any reviewer row. Create a review (pending). Call claim_review with reviewer_id="manual-reviewer-xyz". Verify the claim SUCCEEDS -- unknown reviewer_ids are allowed for backward compatibility with manual/non-pool reviewers.

Fenced reclaim system prevents stale verdicts via claim_generation. claimed_by authorization prevents foreign reviewers from bypassing the fence by omitting claim_generation. Fence bypass prevention rejects verdicts on claimed reviews when both claim_generation and reviewer_id are omitted, closing the final bypass path. Active-status gate prevents draining/terminated reviewers from claiming new work while preserving backward compat for manual reviewers. Drain lifecycle completion auto-terminates draining reviewers when their last claim is resolved (via terminal verdict or reclaim). claim_generation flows through claim -> verdict path. reclaim_review function ready for background task integration in plan 04.
